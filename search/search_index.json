It is designed to allow for meaningful and consistent reporting periods that can be compared and aggregrated accurately as well as to manage the potential 53rd week of the year, which is often a week of extra sales.</p> <p>In practice, this means that the fiscal calendar will often start earlier than the standard Gregorian calendar.</p> <p>Using an example, let's say the fiscal year starts on January 1st and the company starts the week on a Saturday. Depending on the year, the fiscal year could start back up to 6 days before the standard calendar year. So for the year 2015, the fiscal year would actually start on Saturday, December 27th!</p> <p>To minimize some of the potential confusion around the misalignment of a fiscal and gregorian calendar, we push the actual start date of your calendar dimension to the first year where both calendars align. In our example case, that would mean going back to 2011.</p>"},{"location":"products/cal/#using-cal","title":"Using Cal","text":"<p>Once installed, you can start using Cal straight away.
