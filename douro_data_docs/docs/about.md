## About Douro Data

### Why we build data products (too)

As data people, we were curious at what seemed to be the absence of a starter kit for new Snowflake accounts and users.

This led to an opportunity to think about what would be most valuable to any company getting started with cloud data warehousing.

We also like partnering with people who like to do things consistently and well, and using standards to do business is a great starting place for that. If you find any of these products interesting or valuable and are interested in a further partnership, please reach out to us via our [contact form](https://www.dourodata.com/enquiries) or by email at [enquiries@dourodata.com](mailto:enquiries@dourodata.com).
