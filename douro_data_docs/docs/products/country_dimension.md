### Usage Examples

**Example to pull from the dimension table**

```sql
select
country.name,
count(transaction.id) as transaction_counts
from your_transaction_table as transaction
inner join douro_data.country_dimension as country
on transaction.country_id = country.country_id
group by
country.name
```

**Example to insert into fact with fallback Kimball row**

```sql
select
source.id,
source.transaction_amount,
source.transaction_created,
coalesce(country.country_id, -1) as country_id
...
from source_table as source
left outer join douro_data.country_dimension as country
on source.alpha_2_country_code = country.alpha_2
```

### Data update policy

This is an important note copied over from the pycountry repository, which feeds the data for this dimension.

> **_NOTE:_** No changes to the data will be accepted into pycountry. This is a pure wrapper around the ISO standard using the `pkg-isocodes` database from Debian as is.
