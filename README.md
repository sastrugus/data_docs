# data_docs

The public docs repository for Douro Data products

## Local Dev

To start running locally, install the requirements and then run `mkdocs serve`

## Deployment

Any push to `main` will trigger the docs deploy. This will likely be revisited at a later date, but for now will work for our purposes!
